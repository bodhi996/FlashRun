## Domain 

The project is a content based machine learning movie recommender system that uses the attributes and features of the movie in concern and finds the one closes to it. 

## Idea

Recommender System is a system that seeks to predict or filter preferences according to the user‚Äôs choices. Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. 
Recommender systems produce a list of recommendations in any of the two ways ‚Äì 
*  Collaborative filtering: Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from the user‚Äôs past behavior (i.e. items purchased or searched by the user) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that users may have an interest in.
*  Content-based filtering: Content-based filtering approaches uses a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties. Content-based filtering methods are totally based on a description of the item and a profile of the user‚Äôs preferences. It recommends items based on the user‚Äôs past preferences.

The code is well arranged into sub-directories which are -
1. The first page is the ```Frontend``` which comes up once you run the code.
2. The second page is the ```Recommendation``` the algorithm makes for a given movie.
